IG Wealth Management News
IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR ACCOUNT: The switch to a new and enhanced digital platform is continuing throughout 2019 and 2020. The new platform will enable us to expand our service offering and online access to your IG accounts. There is nothing you need to do, and your investments will not be affected. When your account moves, you will receive two statements: a final closing statement with a zero-balance from the current platform, and a new statement with your new account number and up-to-date balance.
If you have multiple accounts with IG, in some instances, not all your accounts will be moved at the same time and you may continue to temporarily hold accounts on both platforms. Should this occur, you will receive two statements until all your accounts are on the new platform. To view samples of current and new statements, visit: www.investorsgroup.com/en/support/about-your-client- statement
