### Book cost
### How we determine book cost
For certain products, we receive the book cost of the security position directly from the product manufacturer and we update our records to reflect this book cost. For other products, our system determines the book cost of the security position. For security positions that are transferred in, the book cost may have been provided or reported by your previous dealer (see Book cost for transferred security positions). While we believe these sources to be reliable, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the book cost shown in this statement. For further information on how we determined the book cost of a particular security position, please contact your advisor.

### Market Price
We obtain market prices from industry sources that we believe to be reliable. When available, we have reported the market price, as at the end of the reporting period, for each investment you hold in your account. If the market price of a security is not determinable, we have identified the position with a NDM notation and excluded it from the total market value calculation. Manulife Securities has established a pricing of securities policy which sets the time frame, varying by investment product, for prices to remain valid before they are marked as not determinable. For more information on Manulife Securities' Pricing of Securities Policy, please contact your advisor.
