A mutual fund pays a management fee from the assets of the fund. Out of that fee, BMO InvestorLine receives a trailing commission for the service we provide to you. The amount of the trailing commission depends on the sales charge option you chose when you purchased the fund. Although you do not pay these trailing commissions directly, they reduce the fund's return to you. For more information about a mutual fund's fees, check the Fund Facts.

For leading-edge mutual fund tools and research, visit us at bmo.com/self-directed and sign in. Go to Research and select Mutual funds. To speak with a BMO InvestorLine investment representative call 1.888.776.6886 between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. ET Monday to Friday.


## \> Bulletin board

You will notice that balanced mutual funds appear under a separate heading in the Details of your investments section but do not appear as such in the Summary of your investments section. To better reflect your asset mix, we have divided the value of your balanced fund holdings equally between the Common equity & related securities and Fixed income & related securities asset categories in the Summary section. While the split between equities and fixed income investments will vary from balanced fund to balanced fund, we feel that a 50-50 split is a fair representation for the purposes of showing your asset mix.

The USD/CAD conversion rate is: 1.2608, as of August 31, 2021

However, the market value cited may be subject to change and we cannot be held responsible if the actual market price differs from the said market price.
