# FOR YOUR INFORMATION

Explanations

Transactions this month Transactions are displayed in chronological order. Opening and month-end balances are also shown. Transactions settling subsequent to the date of the statement are excluded from the security positions.

Security positions Quantities listed as "owing by you" indicate securities which are currently due from you or which you have sold short.

"Segregated securities" are securities held for your account in your name (SFK) or in bearer form (SEG) and may not be used in the conduct of our business while segregated.

Fully paid securities are segregated on the records of our custodian and cannot be used in the normal course of our business. Any free credit balance for non-registered accounts represents funds payable on demand, which although properly recorded in our books, are not segregated and may be used in the normal course of our business.

The Market Value of securities in your account are determined using sources that are considered to be reliable, however we cannot guarantee their accuracy. When CI Investment Services Inc. becomes aware that previous trade prices may not be representative of the Market Value, then the abbreviation of 'not-determinable' (ND) will be used to indicate there is no reliable price information available and, after some period of time, $0.

The Book Value reported on your statement is defined as the total cost including commissions and fees of purchasing a security. A short position will result in a negative book value for that security.

The following superscript notations may be associated with Book Values in the holdings section of your statement.

i) This notation indicates some transactions contributing to this position do not have an associated Book Value. To better reflect changes in the value of this position, Market Value has been used to estimate part or all of the Book Value. For example, if the Book Value was not available for positions transferred to CI Investment Services Inc. then the Market Value as of the date of the transfer was used in lieu of Book Value. For security positions without a Book Value as at December 31, 2015 or an earlier date, the Market Value information as at December 31, 2015 has been used to estimate part or all of the Book Value.

ii) This notation indicates the Book Value for some or all transactions contributing to this position were not determinable. To better reflect changes in value of these positions, where Book Value was unavailable, the Market Value may have been used to estimate part of the Book Value. Where the Market Value was not determinable, a Book Value of N/D or 0 was used.

The Book Value shown in this statement may not be suitable for income tax purposes, as it may not reflect all required adjustments. It is important for you to keep records of all your investment transactions and consult your income tax advisor to properly determine your gains and losses for income tax purposes.

Please note the security description column may contain abbreviation DSC, which indicates that the mutual fund may be subject to a deferred sales charge.

All plan accounts are registered with the Canada Revenue Agency for CI Investment Services Inc., agent for Canadian Western Trust Company. Canadian Western Trust is the Trustee for registered accounts.
