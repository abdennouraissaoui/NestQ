## Additional Information

iA Private Wealth Inc. ("iAPW", "iA Private Wealth", "we", "our" or "us") has an introducing broker/carrying broker agreement with National Bank Financial Inc. (NBF Inc.), through its National Bank Independent Network (NBIN) division. NBIN is a division of and a trade name used by NBF Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of National Bank of Canada. NBIN provides us with trading, clearing and settlement of transactions, recordkeeping, and securities custody services for your account(s) with us, for which the securities therein are held in the custody of NBIN. As the Introducing Broker, we are responsible for determining and supervising the suitability of trading activity, and the opening and initial approval of accounts.

Please review your Account Statements, including the Investment Portfolio Statement ("Statement"). Any errors should be reported to our Compliance Department in writing within 30 days of your receipt of the Statement, otherwise the Statement will be considered correct as printed. For additional information, please speak to your Investment Advisor.

We are required to disclose to the Canada Revenue Agency all transactions involving the disposition of securities, even if no tax forms are produced for such dispositions. Please keep your Statement as a reference for tax purposes.

Customers' accounts are protected by the Canadian Investor Protection Fund ("CIPF") within specified limits. A brochure describing the nature and limits of coverage is available upon request or at www.cipf.ca. Take note that the following are not covered by CIPF: (1) Securities registered in your name and held outside of NBIN or iA Private Wealth; (2) Fully paid securities lent to NBF Inc. under Natcan Trust Company's Retail Client Securities Lending Program (RSL Program). However, fully paid securities not lent under the RSL Program and held with NBIN (acting as a carrying broker) as at the date of the insolvency of either iA Private Wealth Inc. or NBF Inc. are eligible for CIPF coverage.

Copies of our statement of financial position as of our most recent financial year-end and a list of our directors and senior officers are available upon written request.

Any free credit balances in non-registered accounts represent funds payable on demand which, although properly recorded on our books, are not segregated and may be used in the conduct of our business.

Cash balances of registered plans are held by the plan trustee. Industrial Alliance Trust Inc. is the trustee of the following types of registered accounts: RRSP, RRIF, LIRA, LIF, and TFSA. Natcan Trust Company, a subsidiary of the National Bank of Canada, acts as trustee for our RESP and RDSP.

Shareholder Communications (CSA National Instrument 54-101): Your instructions may be modified at any time by providing us with written notice.

iA Private Wealth is a trademark and business name under which iA Private Wealth Inc. operates.


### Portfolio Summary

The amounts shown in this section are in Canadian dollars.

The subsection on Investment Mix indicates how the consolidated financial assets you hold are distributed across each of the basic asset classes. Any securities sold short or debit cash positions are excluded from this asset mix calculation.


#### Detailed Information (by account)

The Cash Flow Summary subsection presents changes in your cash balance during the period. Amounts are shown in the currency of the account, and are classified in broad categories for the current period and the calendar year to date.

Interest rates on debit and credit balances are available upon request; please contact your Investment Advisor for details.

Using borrowed money to finance the purchase of securities involves greater risk than using cash resources only. If you borrow money to purchase securities, your responsibility to repay the loan and pay interest as required by its terms remains the same even if the value of the securities purchased declines.

The Asset Details subsection provides a listing of the securities you hold by asset class.

The "Status" column provides information on how securities in your account(s) are held by NBIN. "SEG" (segregated) indicates fully paid securities which are segregated and held for you in nominee form. "SFK" (safekeeping) indicates fully paid securities, which are segregated and held registered in your name. "OWED" indicates securities you have sold but which have not yet been delivered to NBIN, or securities that were sold short. "UNSG" (unsegregated) indicates securities being held as collateral for your margin loan, and which are therefore not segregated.

The "Book Cost" column means (i) In the case of a long security position, the total amount paid for the security, including any transaction charges related to the purchase, adjusted for reinvested distributions, returns of capital and corporate actions; or (ii) In the case of a short security position, the total amount received for the security, net of any transaction charges related to the sale, adjusted for any distributions (other than dividends), returns of capital and corporate actions.

We do not guarantee the accuracy of, or accept any responsibility for, the book costs and market values shown in the Statement since they may have been acquired from external sources. These amounts should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Where no book cost or market value is available, "N/A" is displayed on your Statement.

The Activity Details subsection presents, in chronological order, all transactions made during the period.


##### All dates of transactions are settlement dates.

Purchases and/or dispositions of securities resulting from transactions settled after month-end will be reflected in the following month's Statement.


## Footnotes

The following footnotes may be shown in the Asset Details section.

(1) Non-determinable market value: This indicates that the market value for a particular security was not determinable.

(2) Book cost at market value: This indicates that market value information was used to estimate all or part of the book cost of the security.

(3) Deferred sales charge: This indicates that the security was purchased on a deferred sales charge (DSC) basis. Depending on the number of years the security is held, charges may be applied by the issuer when the security is sold.

(4) Accrued interest: This indicates, whenever possible, that market values for fixed-income securities include accrued interest.

(5) Estimated market value: This indicates, in the case of securities for which there is no active market, that the market value given is our estimate.


### Abbreviations
